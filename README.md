# A Unified Perception and Decision-Making Framework for Multi-Agent Robots

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

In recent years, multi-agent robotic systems have gained significant attention for applications requiring collaborative task execution, such as search and rescue, autonomous delivery, and surveillance. Traditional frameworks for multi-agent robotics often divide perception and decision-making processes into separate modules, where perception serves as an input to decision-making. However, this disjointed approach can lead to inefficiencies, particularly in dynamic environments where real-time adaptability is crucial. 

This research proposes a **unified framework** that integrates perception and decision-making into a cohesive model, enabling each robot within the multi-agent system to autonomously interpret sensory data and make decisions collaboratively. By leveraging a shared representation of the environment, agents in the proposed framework are able to communicate more effectively, adjust to environmental changes, and coordinate actions without requiring centralized control.

### üöÄ Key Contributions
- üì° **Integrated Perception and Decision-Making:** Fuses sensory input processing and decision logic into a unified model.
- ü§ñ **Decentralized Coordination:** Enables robots to collaborate without relying on a central controller.
- ‚ö° **Adaptive Environment Interaction:** Improves responsiveness in dynamic, unpredictable environments.
- üîç **Enhanced Communication Efficiency:** Utilizes shared environmental representations to optimize agent communication.
- üìà **Proven Effectiveness:** Demonstrated improved task completion and resilience against communication failures in both simulations and real-world tests.

## üß† Framework Architecture

The framework consists of the following core components:

1. **Perception Module:**  
   - Utilizes data from sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs.  
   - Preprocesses and normalizes inputs for downstream decision-making.

2. **Decision-Making Module:**  
   - Employs a reinforcement learning-based policy network.  
   - Dynamically adjusts behaviors based on real-time environmental changes.

3. **Communication Protocol:**  
   - Implements a lightweight, peer-to-peer protocol for inter-agent coordination.  
   - Includes mechanisms for data synchronization and conflict resolution.

4. **Task Execution Engine:**  
   - Assigns and monitors task progress across agents.  
   - Supports flexible task allocation and reallocation strategies.
